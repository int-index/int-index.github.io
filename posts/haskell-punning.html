      Haskell has two namespaces: one for <strong class="ty">types</strong>,
      one for <strong class="tm">terms</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here is a definition of the identity function that uses distinct names
      for the type variable and the term variable:
    </p>
<code class="block">id :: forall <span class="ty">a</span>. <span class="ty">a</span> -&gt; <span class="ty">a</span>
id = \<span class="tm">x</span> -&gt; <span class="tm">x</span></code>
    <p>
      Here is a version that reuses the same name for both variables:
    </p>
<code class="block">id :: forall <span class="ty">a</span>. <span class="ty">a</span> -&gt; <span class="ty">a</span>
id = \<span class="tm">a</span> -&gt; <span class="tm">a</span></code>
    <p>
      The reason we can give two variables the same name is that each lives in
      its own namespace. There is no shadowing here.
    </p>
    <p>
      A similar situation arises when it comes to constructors. Here is the unit type that
      uses distinct names for the type constructor and the data constructor:
    </p>
<code class="block">data <span class="ty">Unit</span> = <span class="tm">U</span></code>
    <p>
      Here is a version that reuses the same name for both constructors:
    </p>
<code class="block">data <span class="ty">Unit</span> = <span class="tm">Unit</span></code>
    <p>
      Haskell uses this style of punning in its standard library and built-in types:
    </p>
<code class="block">data <span class="ty">[a]</span> = <span class="tm">[]</span> | <span class="ty">a</span> <span class="tm">:</span> <span class="ty">[a]</span>
data <span class="ty">(a, b)</span> = <span class="tm">(</span><span class="ty">a</span><span class="tm">,</span> <span class="ty">b</span><span class="tm">)</span>
data <span class="ty">()</span> = <span class="tm">()</span>
data <span class="ty">Proxy a</span> = <span class="tm">Proxy</span>
newtype <span class="ty">Identity a</span> = <span class="tm">Identity</span> <span class="ty">a</span></code>
    <p>
      You might find it elegant or convenient, but it has caused me nothing but pain for several reasons:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Teaching novice programmers requires a thorough explanation of the
        difference between the square brackets in <code class="ty">[Int]</code>
        and <code class="tm">[5]</code>. For someone new to programming, the
        last thing they need is having to distinguish between the meaning of
        <code class="ty">(a,b)</code> and <code class="tm">(a,b)</code> depending on whether the
        thing is to the left or to the right of <code>::</code>!
      </li>
      <li>
        Communicating with fellow Haskellers, sometimes I have to clarify if I
        mean <code class="ty">Proxy</code> the type constructor or <code class="tm">Proxy</code> the
        data constructor, same goes for <code>Identity</code> and other types.
        In this post I employed color to convey this information (<span class="ty">blue</span> for types, <span class="tm">orange</span> for terms).
      </li>
      <li>Type-level programming that uses <code>-XDataKinds</code>
        requires ticks to disambiguate the namespace, for example <code
        class="ty">[]</code> vs <code class="ty">'[]</code>. This is both
        unpleasant to read and confusing to many a syntax highlighter.
      </li>
      <li>Development of future extensions is hindered by this design. For example,
        the ticks of <code>-XDataKinds</code> are in conflict with Template Haskell
        syntax for identifier quotation, which is bad news for type-level
        Template Haskell. There is no way to refer to a type constructor
        in terms, which is bad news for Dependent Haskell.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Using distinct names for type constructors and data constructors is not that difficult:
    </p>
<code class="block">data <span class="ty">List a</span> = <span class="tm">[]</span> | <span class="ty">a</span> <span class="tm">:</span> <span class="ty">[a]</span>
data <span class="ty">Pair a b</span> = <span class="tm">(</span><span class="ty">a</span><span class="tm">,</span> <span class="ty">b</span><span class="tm">)</span>
data <span class="ty">Unit</span> = <span class="tm">()</span>
data <span class="ty">Proxy a</span> = <span class="tm">P</span>
newtype <span class="ty">Identity a</span> = <span class="tm">Id</span> <span class="ty">a</span></code>
    <p>
      However, it is probably too late to consider this.
    </p>
    <p>
      We would be better off if Haskell did not have this style of punning in
      the first place. Designers of new programming languages, my plea to you:
      learn from this mistake and resist the temptation of meaningless overloading!
